# Project 3: Spots

Spots is a responsive webpage design. Which is made to adapt to various browser screen sizes depending on the user's device; for example, from desktop, tablet, or mobile devices.

I created the code for this webpage in VScode whilst, using the design format provided in Figma. 

The desktop view is limited to a maximum of 1440px in width. This webpage contains the design style of the Spots heading and user profile below as well as the user’s posted images with descriptions. The profile section is made to be user-friendly while keeping the design consistant. Essentially any text overflow is ellipsed and limited to 3 rows for the username, profile, and image descriptions. 

The overall font style for this page is “Poppins”, with the alternatives of Arial and Sans-serif. 

All buttons have applied hover effects. The “edit profile” button’s default style keeps a grey color until the cursor hovers above the targeted area. Changing the button from grey to a bold black and the cursor to a pointer. The opposite style is applied to the “New Post” button, from the bold solid color to a grey transition. 

The new post button is a mock button to be available for the user to add new images to their profiles. Each image is limited to a width and height of 413px. Continuing the suggested design layout of the grid display function, positioning all images centered within the page and display all images in a row and column of 3 while viewing on a desktop. 

If the webpage is accessed from other devices such as a tablet or mobile device. The display will slightly change from a row of 3 to 2 rows for a tablet depending on screen resolution. Also, a singular row for a mobile device. This feature is applied using an @media query with a max screen width of 627px and resizing the images to 288px.
